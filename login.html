Welcome back, Valerius Students. I canâ€™t wait to see all your smiling faces again! Letâ€™s walk down our hallways to a great year filled with learning new things, working together, and having a lot of fun! I wonder how many students remember our three Valerius behavior expectations (Hint: R, R and S). See you soon!
Smiles~ Mrs. MacGregor, Valerius School Counselor

Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing my former 1st grade students as we begin 3rd grade.  Iâ€™m so lucky to have you back in my life! ðŸ™‚
Diane Gruba, 3rd grade, Webster</p>
